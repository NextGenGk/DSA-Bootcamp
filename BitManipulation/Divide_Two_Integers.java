Algorithm / Intuition
We can simulate division by repeated addition of the divisor until the sum exceeds the dividend.
The quotient is then determined by the number of times the divisor was added to reach or slightly
exceed the dividend.

Note: This approach will not handle certain edge cases like negative integers and overflow.

Algorithm:

Step 1:Initialise two integer variables sum and cnt to 0.
    1. sum represents the current accumulated sum.
    2. cnt represents the quotient
Step 2: Enter a loop that continues as long as sum + divisor is less than or equal to dividend.
    1. At each iteration of the loop, increment cnt by 1.
    2. Add divisor to sum.
Step 3:Return the quotient cnt as a result.

// Intuition : Optimal Solution (Repeated Subtraction)
/*
Algorithm / Intuition
Repeated Subtraction is the approach for integer division where we break down the division
process by repeatedly subtracting multiples of the divisor from the dividend until the
dividend becomes smaller than the divisor.

Algorithm :
1. Handle the overflow case when dividing Integer.MIN_VALUE by -1.
2. Check if dividend and divisor are equal, return 1 if true.
3. Determine the sign of the result, true for positive, false for negative.
4. If dividend is positive and divisor is negative, set sign to negative.
5. If dividend is negative and divisor is positive, set sign to negative.
6. Take absolute values of dividend and divisor.
7. Initialize quotient to 0.
8. Perform division using repeated subtraction.
9. Count how many times divisor can be doubled before exceeding dividend.
10. Add the value corresponding to the current doubling to the quotient.
11. Subtract the product of divisor and the doubled value from dividend.
12. Handle overflow cases.
13. If quotient equals (2^31) and the result is supposed to be positive, return Integer.MAX_VALUE.
14. If quotient equals (2^31) and the result is supposed to be negative, return Integer.MIN_VALUE.
15. Return the quotient with correct sign.
