1. Understanding Celebrity Characteristics:
A celebrity is someone who:
    i. Is known by everyone (i.e., all other n-1 people should know this person).
   ii. Does not know anyone (i.e., this person should not know any other person).

2. Matrix Representation:
The matrix matrix[i][j] == 1 means that person i knows person j. Using this, we can gather information
about how many people each person knows (iKnow) and how many people know them (knowMe).

3. Tracking Information with Arrays:
The code uses two arrays:
    i. knowMe[i]: How many people know person i.
   ii. iKnow[i]: How many people person i knows.
By populating these arrays, the code can check for the celebrity conditions:
    i. knowMe[i] == n - 1: This means person i is known by everyone else.
   ii. iKnow[i] == 0: This means person i knows no one.

4. Checking for the Celebrity:
After counting the "known by" and "knows" relationships, the algorithm checks if any person satisfies
the celebrity criteria. If such a person exists, their index is returned. If no person meets the criteria,
it returns -1 to indicate no celebrity.

Problem Statement
In a party of n people (numbered 0 to n-1), a celebrity is a person who:

✅ Is known by everyone else
❌ Does not know anyone else

The matrix matrix[i][j] is:
1 → person i knows person j
0 → person i does not know person j

We want to return the index of the celebrity, or -1 if there is no celebrity.

/*
Step-by-step Logic
🔁 Step 1: Eliminate Non-Celebrities
Use two pointers:
1. top starts from 0
2. bottom starts from n-1

Compare:
1. If matrix[top][bottom] == 1, then top knows bottom, so top can't be a celebrity, move top up.
2. Otherwise, bottom can't be a celebrity, move bottom down.
3. Eventually, top will point to a potential celebrity.

🔍 Step 2: Verify the Candidate
Once a candidate is found (let’s say top = C), we verify:
1. matrix[C][i] == 0 for all i ≠ C → C doesn't know anyone
2. matrix[i][C] == 1 for all i ≠ C → everyone knows C

If any of these checks fail → return -1.
 */

/*
Example
Let's take the following matrix of 4 people:

int[][] matrix = {
    {0, 1, 1, 0},
    {0, 0, 1, 0},
    {0, 0, 0, 0}, // Candidate celebrity
    {0, 1, 1, 0}
};

Step 1: Eliminate non-celebrities
Start:

top = 0, bottom = 3
1. matrix[0][3] == 0 → 0 doesn’t know 3 → 3 can’t be celebrity → bottom-- → bottom = 2
2. matrix[0][2] == 1 → 0 knows 2 → 0 can’t be celebrity → top++ → top = 1
3. matrix[1][2] == 1 → 1 knows 2 → 1 can’t be celebrity → top++ → top = 2

Now top == bottom == 2 → Candidate is person 2

➤ Step 2: Verify person 2
Check if person 2 knows no one:

1. matrix[2][0] == 0 ✅
2. matrix[2][1] == 0 ✅
3. matrix[2][3] == 0 ✅

Check if everyone knows person 2:

1. matrix[0][2] == 1 ✅
2. matrix[1][2] == 1 ✅
3. matrix[3][2] == 1 ✅

All checks pass → ✅ Return 2

✅ Final Output
System.out.println(findCelebrity1(matrix)); // Output: 2

// Approach : Optimal Solution
/*

The intuition behind this code is rooted in efficiently narrowing down the possible celebrity among n people
based on specific characteristics of a celebrity. The goal is to find one person who is known by everyone
else but does not know anyone.

Core Celebrity Characteristics:

A celebrity is known by everyone: This means, for a potential celebrity at index i, all matrix[j][i] == 1 for j ≠ i.
A celebrity knows no one: This means, for a potential celebrity at index i, all matrix[i][j] == 0 for j ≠ i.

Algorithm Intuition:
1. Two-Pointer Elimination Strategy:
    1. The idea is to eliminate non-celebrities by comparing pairs of people using two pointers: top starting
        at 0 and bottom starting at n-1.
    2. If matrix[top][bottom] == 1, it means top knows bottom, so top cannot be a celebrity, and the top
        pointer moves up.
    3. If matrix[top][bottom] == 0, it means top might be a celebrity since they don’t know bottom,
    so bottom cannot be a celebrity, and the bottom pointer moves down.
        4. This process narrows down the possible celebrity to one candidate by eliminating potential candidates
    from both ends of the array.

2. Verifying the Candidate:
    1. After the elimination loop, the potential celebrity will be at index top.
    2. To confirm if the person at top is indeed the celebrity, we perform a second check:
        1. The potential celebrity should not know anyone (matrix[top][i] == 0 for all i).
        2. Everyone should know the potential celebrity (matrix[i][top] == 1 for all i).
    3. If the person at top satisfies these conditions, they are the celebrity; otherwise, no celebrity exists.

Why It Works:
1. Efficiency: The two-pointer strategy reduces the problem space by eliminating non-celebrities in a
single pass (O(n) complexity). Instead of comparing every person to every other person
(which would take O(n²)), we only focus on narrowing down the potential celebrity and then validating
the candidate.

2. Intuition of Celebrity Definition: The elimination works because of the symmetric nature of the "knows"
relationship. If person top knows person bottom, we can definitively say that top cannot be a celebrity.
Conversely, if top doesn't know bottom, then bottom can't be a celebrity. This process continues until
one candidate remains.
