// Approach / Intuition : Optimal Solution
/*
We can approach this question by maintaining two counters to keep track of the available 5$ and 10$ bills.
We iterate through the customers and provide change accordingly.

If a customer pays with a 5$ bill, we simply keep it as we will not have to provide any change.
If the customer pays with a 10$ bill, we check if there is at least one 5$ bill available to
provide change and decrement the counter.

If the customer uses a 20$ bill, we provide change using 5$ and 10$ bills or with three 5$ bills.
If at any point, we are not able to provide the required change we return false.

Otherwise, if we successfully serve all customers with the correct change, we can return true.

Algorithm:
Step 1:Initialise two counters, fives and tens to keep track of the number of 5$ and 10$ bills at hand.
Initialise them to zero as we hold no change at the starting.

Step 2: Loop through each bill in the bills array and check the following: If the bill is 5$,
increment the fives counter.

Step 3: If the bill is 10$, check if there are any 5$ bills available.
    1. If yes, provide change by incrementing the 10$ bill counter and decrementing the 5$ bill counter.
    2. If there are no 5$ bills available, return false as we cannot provide change.

Step 4: If the current bill is 20$, check if both 5$ and 10$ bills are available. If yes, provide
change by decreasing the counter of 5$ and 10$ bills.
    1. If there are not enough 10$ bills available, check if there are at atleast three 5$ bills available.
       If yes, provide change by decreasing the 5$ counter by 3.
    2. If not able to provide change, return false.

Step 5: If all customers are served with the correct change, we exit out of the loop and return true.
