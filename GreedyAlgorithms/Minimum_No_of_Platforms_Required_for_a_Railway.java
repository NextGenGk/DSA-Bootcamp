// Approach / Intuition : Brute Force
/*
Intuition: Take each interval of arrival and departure one by one and count the number of overlapping
time intervals. This can easily be done using nested for-loops. Maintain the maximum value of the
count during the process and return the maximum value at the end.
 */

// Approach / Intuition : Optimal Solution
/*
The intuition behind this code is to simulate train arrivals and departures in chronological order by
sorting both the arrival and departure times. By using two pointers â€” one for arrivals and one for
departures  we can track when a train arrives and when the next train departs. If a train arrives
before the previous one departs, an additional platform is needed, and if a train departs before
the next one arrives, a platform is freed. The goal is to find the maximum number of platforms needed
at any time by tracking overlaps between arrivals and departures efficiently.
