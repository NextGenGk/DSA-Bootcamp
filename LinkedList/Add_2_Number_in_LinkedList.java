Intuition:

Keep track of the carry using a variable and simulate digits-by-digits sum starting from the head of the list,
which contains the least significant digit. Just like how you would sum two numbers on a piece of paper,
we begin by summing the least significant digits, which is the head of l1 and l2. Since each digit is in
the range of 0â€¦9, summing two digits may "overflow". For example

5 + 7 = 12. In this case, we set the current digit to 2 and bring over the carry=1 to the next iteration.

carry must be either 0 or 1 because the largest possible sum of two digits (including the carry)
is 9 + 9 + 1 = 19.

Psuedocode:

1. Create a dummy node which is the head of new linked list.
2. Create a node temp, initialise it with dummy.
3. Initialize carry to 0.
4. Loop through lists l1 and l2 until you reach both ends, and until carry is present.
    i. Set sum=l1.val+ l2.val + carry.
   ii. Update carry=sum/10.
  iii. Create a new node with the digit value of (sum%10) and set it to temp node's next, then advance temp node to next.
5. Advance both l1 and l2.
6. Return dummy's next node.

Note that we use a dummy head to simplify the code. Without a dummy head, you would have to write extra
conditional statements to initialize the head's value.

Take extra caution in the following cases:

Test case	Explanation
l1=[0,1], l2=[0,1,2]	When one list is longer than the other.
l1=[], l2=[0,1]	When one list is null, which means an empty list.
l1=[9,9], l2=[1]	The sum could have an extra carry of one at the end, which is easy to forget.
