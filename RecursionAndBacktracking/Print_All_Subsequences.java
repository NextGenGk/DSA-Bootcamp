// Intuition : Optimal Solution
/*
Intuition
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements
without changing the order of the remaining elements.

To generate subsequences using recursion :
1. Pick the current element and include it in the subsequence.
2. Donâ€™t pick the current element and move to the next index.
3. Repeat this for all elements until you reach the base case (i.e., index out of bounds).
4. This approach ensures that all possible subsequences are generated.

Algorithm :
1. Create a recursive function generateSubsequences(arr, index, currentSubsequence).
2. Base Case: If index == arr.length, print the current subsequence and return.
3. Pick the element at index and recurse with index + 1.
4. Don't pick the element at index and recurse with index + 1.
